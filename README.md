# Expo WebBrowser Silent Failure on Android

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Expo's WebBrowser API where opening a browser on certain Android devices can fail silently. The result object returned by `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` may be inconsistent or lack expected properties, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description
The `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` function may not always return a reliable result object on Android.  In some cases, it may appear to succeed but the browser may not actually open, or it may fail without providing clear error information in the result.

## Reproduction
1. Run the provided `bug.js` code on an Android device.
2. Observe the behavior. On some devices, the browser will open correctly. On others, it may fail silently and the console log may show unexpected or missing data.

## Solution
The provided `bugSolution.js` provides a more robust approach by adding additional error handling and checking for specific properties in the result object to help identify potential issues. This offers more reliable feedback and improved debugging capabilities.
